# SnailyMenu
SnailyMenu is server sided menu for FiveM servers, including full\* permission support.


\*(Some features do not have permissions support. However, they will be disabled if you deny access to the submenu that they are a part of (eg: unlimited stamina in Player Options will be disabled if you deny `vMenu.PlayerOptions.Menu`.))

# Download & Installation & Permissions

## Download

Click [here](https://github.com/TomGrobbe/vMenu/releases) to go to the releases page and download it.

--------

## Installation
Please follow the instructions over at the [SnailyMenu docs](https://docs.snaily.run/snailymenu/installation)

## Zap Hosting
If you're using Zap Hosting, you may find that moving the `permissions.cfg` file to the same folder as your `server.cfg` file may not work correctly (it could get reset every time you restart your server).

If this is the case, leave your `permissions.cfg` file here: `/resources/SnailyMenu/config/permissions.cfg` and add the following to the very top of your server.cfg file: `exec resources/SnailyMenu/config/permissions.cfg` (instead of `exec permissions.cfg`).

You can also use ZAP Hosting's one-click installer for SnailyMenu.
